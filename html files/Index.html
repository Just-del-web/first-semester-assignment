       My name is Justice Nmezi and am 19 I am from IMO state my hobby is reading and constructing stuffs I got into tech cause I love science and stuffs about computing and space. I finished my basic education in the year 2015 then I when on to high school, I then graduated from high school in the year 2022, and now am currently studying cybersecurity at university of portharcourt. Through out my life i have loved science and to be precise I love rocket science. Let me tell you a little story of what my love for science looked like. When i was in high school I carried out a whole lot of reasearch to quantify if I could design a minirocket, or make a kind of miniature rocket. So therefore I delved into my finding and the good thing was that my school had a fully functional and well equipped laboratory. From my findings I discovered that sugar could generate energy by burning it cause it can serve as a fuel but then there was a problem the sugar had to burn fast in other to generate the lift I needed and sugar burns slowly naturally. As i kept reaserching i then found that pottasium nitrate could act as an oxidizer to make the sugar burn fast, and where i found it was in fertiizer npk(nitogen phosphorus pottasium) so I used it to make my rocket and that was how I succeeded. My country does not have the facilities to teach rocket science so I just have to learn software engineering cause its a part of the rocket development. About my family though my parents are not wealthy but we are thriving despite the thoughness of my country "Nigeria". And this is one of the major reasons why i have to be serious, so that i can secure a job and be assured of financial security in the future. That's just a little about me as I go futher through the learning journey, ALT school will get to know me better and i will be among those that will tell their success stories.    ]

    <strong>Reason for joining ALT school</strong>I joined ALT school and the reason is because i think that Alt-School will give me the needed tutoring and effective teaching i need to get acquainted with the skills i need. If i were to rate ALT School i would rate them 5 stars. Why i have this strong conviction is because of Alt schools goal which is to teach tech to 1million Africans before 2030. I see that as another good factor for joining ALT School. Alt school also offers cheaper tuition and a flexible payment scheme and this help make it easy for anyone who wants to get into tech.
